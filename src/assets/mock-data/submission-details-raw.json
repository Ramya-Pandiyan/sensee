  "email": "### üè¢ Property Overview\nThe submission centers on a modern, high-rise condominium located at 24-16 Queens Plaza South, Long Island City, NY. Built in 2019, this 22-story, fire-resistive structure combines residential apartments with a mercantile (merc) component, specifically a bank tenant. The property spans <span style=\"color:yellow\">110,553 sq ft</span> and is valued at a <span style=\"color:green\">replacement cost</span> basis, reflecting a robust, contemporary asset profile in a dense urban environment. The insured's mailing address is 260 Madison Avenue, 12th Floor, New York, NY 10016.\n\n- 22-story, fire-resistive construction (built 2019)\n- Mixed-use: residential apartments and bank tenant (merc)\n- <span style=\"color:yellow\">110,553 sq ft</span> total area\n- Located in Long Island City, NY (Brooklyn reference in email, but address is Queens)\n- Replacement cost valuation (except ALS on Business Income)\n\n### üí∞ Coverage Structure & Limits\nThe broker requests a comprehensive all-risk property program, including <span style=\"color:yellow\">flood, earthquake (EQ), and equipment breakdown</span>. The total insured value (TIV) is <span style=\"color:green\">$52,615,000</span>, with specific limits for building, business personal property (BPP), and business income/extra expense (BI/EE). Ordinance or Law coverage is sought at <span style=\"color:yellow\">Full A and 10% B&C</span>.\n\n- Building: <span style=\"color:green\">$50,905,000</span>\n- BPP: <span style=\"color:yellow\">$100,000</span>\n- BI/EE: <span style=\"color:yellow\">$1,610,000</span>\n- TIV: <span style=\"color:green\">$52,615,000</span>\n- Ordinance or Law: Full A, 10% B&C\n- Valuation: Replacement Cost (except ALS on BI)\n\n### üõ°Ô∏è Deductibles & Special Terms\nThe submission outlines a detailed deductible structure, reflecting the insured's appetite for risk retention across various perils. Notably, the <span style=\"color:yellow\">flood and earthquake deductibles</span> are set at <span style=\"color:yellow\">$100,000</span> and <span style=\"color:yellow\">$50,000</span> per occurrence, respectively, with similar retentions for water damage and sewer backup. The all other perils (AOP) deductible is <span style=\"color:yellow\">$25,000 per occurrence</span>.\n\n- EQ: <span style=\"color:yellow\">$50,000 per occurrence</span>\n- Flood: <span style=\"color:yellow\">$100,000 per occurrence</span>\n- Sewer Backup: <span style=\"color:yellow\">$50,000</span>\n- Water Damage: <span style=\"color:yellow\">$50,000</span>\n- AOP: <span style=\"color:yellow\">$25,000 per occurrence</span>\n\n### üìÑ Loss History & Attachments\nThe submission includes loss runs for the past two years, both involving <span style=\"color:red\">accidental discharge from plumbing</span>. The 2020-2021 period saw a loss of <span style=\"color:red\">$230,003</span>, while the 2021-2022 period experienced a significantly higher loss of <span style=\"color:red\">$945,933</span>. These figures highlight a <span style=\"color:red\">notable water damage exposure</span> that warrants further scrutiny. Attachments also include the SOV and full loss runs for detailed review.\n\n- 3/12/2020‚Äì12/2021: Accidental plumbing discharge, <span style=\"color:red\">$230,003</span>\n- 3/12/2021‚Äì3/12/2022: Accidental plumbing discharge, <span style=\"color:red\">$945,933</span>\n- SOV and loss runs provided as attachments\n\n### üè¶ Occupancy & Tenant Profile\nThe property is a mixed-use asset with residential apartments and a mercantile component, specifically a bank tenant. This occupancy mix can be favorable from a risk perspective, as financial institutions typically maintain high standards for security and maintenance. However, the presence of a bank may also introduce unique exposures (e.g., higher foot traffic, cash handling).\n\n- Residential apartments (primary use)\n- Mercantile tenant: bank\n- Potential for <span style=\"color:yellow\">increased water damage risk</span> due to recent loss history\n- Bank occupancy may enhance overall risk profile but requires confirmation of tenant risk controls\n\n\n---\n\nI can help with a few things ‚Äî which would you like me to handle next?\n  1. Email the broker to request the missing information: confirmation of occupancy breakdown (residential vs. mercantile sq ft), details on water damage mitigation measures post-loss, and clarification on the correct borough (Brooklyn vs. Queens).\n  2. Find out more about the insured.\n  3. Review or create a summary of the Loss Run (if available).\n  4. Review or create a summary of the SOVs (if available).",

  "sov": "## üè¢ Property Overview\nThe submission details a single location: **24-16 Queens Plaza South Condominium** in Long Island City, NY. The property is a condominium structure, identified as Building 1, with a substantial <span style=\"color:yellow\">110,553 square feet</span> and <span style=\"color:yellow\">109 units</span>. The building was constructed in <span style=\"color:yellow\">2019</span>, indicating modern standards and likely compliance with recent building codes. However, the SOV lacks critical financial and occupancy data, which limits the ability to fully assess risk exposure and valuation accuracy.\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Construction & Condition\nThe SOV lists the property type as \"FR\" (presumably Fire Resistive), which is generally favorable for risk mitigation. However, there is <span style=\"color:red\">no information provided on construction details, roof condition, or updates</span>. The absence of roof replacement year and construction description raises concerns about long-term durability and maintenance standards.\n\n## üìä Valuation & Occupancy\nAll value fields‚Äîincluding building, contents, BI/rental, M&E, and other‚Äîare reported as <span style=\"color:red\">zero</span>, resulting in a <span style=\"color:red\">TIV of zero</span>. This is a critical issue, as it prevents any meaningful assessment of insurable interest or premium calculation. Additionally, occupancy details are missing, with <span style=\"color:red\">zero percent occupancy</span> and no descriptive information, which is inconsistent with the presence of 109 units and a recent build year.\n\n## üìù Key Facts & Considerations\n- <span style=\"color:yellow\">Location:</span> Long Island City, NY, zip code 11101\n- <span style=\"color:yellow\">Year Built:</span> 2019 (recent construction)\n- <span style=\"color:yellow\">Square Footage:</span> 110,553; <span style=\"color:yellow\">Units:</span> 109\n- <span style=\"color:red\">All valuation fields are zero</span> (building, contents, BI/rental, M&E, other, TIV)\n- <span style=\"color:red\">Occupancy and construction details are missing or incomplete</span>\n- <span style=\"color:yellow\">No ownership entity specified</span>\n- <span style=\"color:yellow\">No updates or roof replacement year provided</span>\n\n## üö¶ Risk Implications\nThe lack of valuation and occupancy data is a <span style=\"color:red\">critical barrier</span> to underwriting. Without these details, risk exposure, premium adequacy, and coverage needs cannot be determined. The recent build year and fire resistive type are <span style=\"color:green\">positive indicators</span>, but the absence of supporting information introduces significant uncertainty.\n\n\n---\n\nI can help with a few things ‚Äî which would you like me to handle next?\n  1. Email the broker to request the missing information: Building Value, Contents Value, BI/Rental Value, M&E Value, Other Value, Total Insured Value (TIV), Occupancy Description, Percentage Occupied, Construction Description, Roof Condition, Ownership Entity, Year Updated, Roof Replacement Year, AIR Occupancy and Construction Codes/Descriptions.\n  2.
